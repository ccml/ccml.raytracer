Scenario: The transformation matrix for the default orientation
   Given from ← point(0, 0, 0)
     And to ← point(0, 0, -1)
     And up ← vector(0, 1, 0)
    When t ← view_transform(from, to, up)
    Then t = identity_matrix

Scenario: A view transformation matrix looking in positive z direction
   Given from ← point(0, 0, 0)
     And to ← point(0, 0, 1)
     And up ← vector(0, 1, 0)
    When t ← view_transform(from, to, up)
    Then t = scaling(-1, 1, -1)

Scenario: The view transformation moves the world
   Given from ← point(0, 0, 8)
     And to ← point(0, 0, 0)
     And up ← vector(0, 1, 0)
    When t ← view_transform(from, to, up)
    Then t = translation(0, 0, -8)

Scenario: An arbitrary view transformation
   Given from ← point(1, 3, 2)
     And to ← point(4, -2, 8)
     And up ← vector(1, 1, 0)
    When t ← view_transform(from, to, up)
    Then t is the following 4x4 matrix:
       | -0.50709 | 0.50709 | 0.67612 | -2.36643 |
       | 0.76772 | 0.60609 | 0.12122 | -2.82843 |
       | -0.35857 | 0.59761 | -0.71714 | 0.00000 |
       | 0.00000 | 0.00000 | 0.00000 | 1.00000 |
