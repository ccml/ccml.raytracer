Scenario: An intersection encapsulates t and object
   Given s ← sphere()
    When i ← intersection(3.5, s)
    Then i.t = 3.5
     And i.object = s

Scenario: Intersect sets the object on the intersection
   Given r ← ray(point(0, 0, -5), vector(0, 0, 1))
     And s ← sphere()
    When xs ← intersect(s, r)
    Then xs.count = 2
     And xs[0].object = s
     And xs[1].object = s

Scenario: The hit, when all intersections have positive t
   Given s ← sphere()
     And i1 ← intersection(1, s)
     And i2 ← intersection(2, s)
     And xs ← intersections(i2, i1)
    When i ← hit(xs)
    Then i = i1

Scenario: The hit, when some intersections have negative t
   Given s ← sphere()
     And i1 ← intersection(-1, s)
     And i2 ← intersection(1, s)
     And xs ← intersections(i2, i1)
    When i ← hit(xs)
    Then i = i2

Scenario: The hit, when all intersections have negative t
   Given s ← sphere()
     And i1 ← intersection(-2, s)
     And i2 ← intersection(-1, s)
     And xs ← intersections(i2, i1)
    When i ← hit(xs)
    Then i is nothing

Scenario: The hit is always the lowest nonnegative intersection
   Given s ← sphere()
     And i1 ← intersection(5, s)
     And i2 ← intersection(7, s)
     And i3 ← intersection(-3, s)
     And i4 ← intersection(2, s)
     And xs ← intersections(i1, i2, i3, i4)
    When i ← hit(xs)
    Then i = i4
